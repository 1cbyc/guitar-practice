# My Guitar Practice Journal

Things I've learned along the way:

* I discovered that my right hand needs to glide over the strings. It can stay pretty relaxed while still muting properly. I realized it doesn't need to be parallel to the strings when playing the low notes - that was causing unnecessary tension.

* I'm working on keeping my left hand steady. I noticed it was wiggling when I used my pinky, which was throwing off my accuracy. Still practicing this one.

* I learned that my right hand should move from the elbow, not the shoulder. My shoulder was getting tense, but now I keep it relaxed and anchor my hand to the guitar body most of the time. This feels much more natural.

* I had a breakthrough moment when I realized I was fretting two strings with my left index finger! I tested this with hammer-ons and pull-offs - got tons of noise even with alternate picking. The fix: I had to stop laying my index finger flat on the strings. Now I angle the pad just like my other fingers and curl it around the strings. Made a huge difference.

* I'm learning to be patient with myself. It's okay to start playing quietly and build strength gradually. I don't need to force it.

* Pick angling is crucial. I struggled with alternate picking until I realized my flat pick was getting stuck on strings. Angling it changed everything.

* I found a helpful trick: touching the strings with just the tip of the pick. When I'm not playing, I place the pick tip on the string I'm about to pluck to feel how deep it should go. This helps me stay consistent.

* I've learned to take breaks when I feel strain. Building tolerance takes time, and pushing through prolonged exercises without breaks was actually hurting my progress.

* I caught myself "planting" my index finger on a string - being lazy with it. I found that lifting it slightly when not in use actually helps me move faster to the next string. Small adjustment, big impact.
